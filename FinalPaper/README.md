### Mitigating Racial Bias in Recidivism Prediction: Machine Learning & Threshold Selection Approach

### Abstract
The algorithm COMPAS, which is used by many courts in USA to assess the recidivism likelihood of defendants, has been accused of racial bias. This paper assesses COMPAS’s classification setting in defining ‘low’, ‘medium’, ‘high’ risks and tries to select proper threshold for each racial group so that the tool can improve its algorithm fairness whilst having good predictive performance. It also uses machine learning methods separately by splitting race feature as a protected attribute to examine if such method will reduce bias.
